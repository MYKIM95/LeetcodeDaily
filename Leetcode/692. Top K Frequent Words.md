Problem From.

https://leetcode.com/problems/top-k-frequent-words/

Today's problem can be solved by using some functions.

```
class Solution {
    fun topKFrequent(words: Array<String>, k: Int): List<String> {
        
        return words.groupingBy { it }.eachCount()
        .toList()
        .sortedBy { (s, _) -> s }
        .sortedByDescending { (_, v) -> v }
        .map { it.first }
        .take(k)
        
    }
}
```

First, groupingBy.eachCount() count frequency and make group.

sortedBy (s, ) will sort group by lexicographical order.

sortedBy ( , v) will sort group by frequency descending.

map {it.first} will return the keys of group and take(k) will return k words.

Using functions in appropritate way is also important in problem solving.
