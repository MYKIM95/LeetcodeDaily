https://leetcode.com/problems/check-if-two-string-arrays-are-equivalent/

Today's problem was really simple. Using given two arrays, if sums of each two arrays are same, return true. If not, return false.

Use reduce method to get the sum of array.

```
class Solution {
    fun arrayStringsAreEqual(word1: Array<String>, word2: Array<String>): Boolean {
        
        val word1Sum = word1.reduce { total, next -> total + next }
        val word2Sum = word2.reduce { total, next -> total + next }
        
        return word1Sum == word2Sum
    }
}
```
