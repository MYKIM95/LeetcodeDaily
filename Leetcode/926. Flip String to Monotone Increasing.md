Problem From.

https://leetcode.com/problems/flip-string-to-monotone-increasing/

This is typical DP problem

When length of binary string is 1, no need to flip.

If 1 comes next, also no need to flip because it is already monotone increasing.

If 0 comes next, it divides into two ways.

First, flip 0 to 1. In this case, we need to change all 0 into 1 before.

Second, just add 1. In this case, we need to accumulate how many 1 are added into String, because we need to repeat this progress.

Use Math.min function to find which choice is the best in each progress.

The timeComplexity of this problem will be O(N)

```
class Solution {
    fun minFlipsMonoIncr(s: String): Int {
        var addOne = 0
        var considerFlip = 0
        for (i in 0 until s.length) {
            if (s[i] == '1') {
                addOne += 1
            } else {
                considerFlip += 1
            }
            considerFlip = Math.min(addOne, considerFlip)
        }
        return considerFlip
    }
}
```
