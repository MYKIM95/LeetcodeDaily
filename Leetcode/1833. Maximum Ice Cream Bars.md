Today's problem is quite simple. Sort the icecream cost array and accumulate total cost until it becomes bigger than given coins.

    fun maxIceCream(costs: IntArray, coins: Int): Int {
        var answer = 0 
        val sortedCosts = costs.sorted()
        var total = 0
        for(i in 0 until sortedCosts.size) {
            total += sortedCosts[i]
            if(total <= coins) answer += 1
            else break
        }
        return answer
