Problem From.

https://leetcode.com/problems/delete-the-middle-node-of-a-linked-list/

Today's problem is returing linkedList after delete middle node.

The core part of this problem is finding middle position of LinkedList.

I used two pointer algorithm to find the middle point.

For the first point, increase position by one while second point increases position by two.

When second point reaches to the end, the first point will be in the middle point.

Then, insert next node of first point to the first point to delete middle node.

```
/**
 * Example:
 * var li = ListNode(5)
 * var v = li.`val`
 * Definition for singly-linked list.
 * class ListNode(var `val`: Int) {
 *     var next: ListNode? = null
 * }
 */
class Solution {
    fun deleteMiddle(head: ListNode?): ListNode? {
        
        if(head!!.next == null) return null
        
        findMiddle(head, head?.next?.next)
        
        return head
    }
    
    private fun findMiddle(head : ListNode?, pointTwo : ListNode?) {
        
        if(pointTwo?.next == null) {
            head!!.next = head!!.next?.next
            return
        }
        
        findMiddle(head?.next, pointTwo?.next?.next)
    }
    
}
```

Two pointer alogrithm is useful when finding middle point or finding specific pattern.
