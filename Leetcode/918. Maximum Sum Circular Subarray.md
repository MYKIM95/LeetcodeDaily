Problem From.

https://leetcode.com/problems/maximum-sum-circular-subarray/

Today's problem can be solved with Kadane's algorithm which based on Dynamic Programming.

One thing we need to consider is the array is circular array.

So we need to consider two paths.

First, when the max array is in the original array.

Second, when the max array is made with end part of array and first part of array.

In the second case, we have an idea that if max array is made, then the rest of part is min array.

Therefore, we need to find min array with Kadane's algorithm.

```
class Solution {
    fun maxSubarraySumCircular(nums: IntArray): Int {
        
        var localMax = 0
        var globalMax = nums[0]
        var localMin = 0
        var globalMin = nums[0]
        
        for(i in 0 until nums.size) {
            
            localMax = Math.max(nums[i], localMax + nums[i])
            if(localMax > globalMax) {
                globalMax = localMax
            }
            localMin = Math.min(nums[i], localMin + nums[i])
            if(localMin < globalMin) {
                globalMin = localMin
            }
            
        }
        
        return if(localMin == nums.sum()) globalMax else Math.max(globalMax, nums.sum() - globalMin)
        
    }
}
```

The time complexity of this solution is O(N)
