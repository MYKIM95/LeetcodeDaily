Problem From.

https://leetcode.com/problems/longest-palindrome-by-concatenating-two-letter-words/

Use elements in the given list, make the longest palindrome.

Use HashMap to find the pair in the list. Inspect list from start to end, if element is not in the map, add to map.

If reversed string is already in the map, add 4 to answer.

Furthermore, we need to consider the element which is already palindrome like 'gg'.

To find this, loop map in the end and add 2 to the answer if the half of the answer length is odd.

For example, abcddcba has length 8 and half of length is 4 which is even.

However, abcdggdcba has length 10 and half of length is 5 which is odd.

We can add the element already palindrome only when half of length is even.

```
class Solution {
    fun longestPalindrome(words: Array<String>): Int {
        
        var answer = 0
        
        val map = HashMap<String, Int>()
        
        var hasMiddle = false
        
        words.forEach { word ->
            
            if(word.reversed() == word) hasMiddle = true
            if(map.containsKey(word.reversed())) {
                if(map.get(word.reversed())!! > 1) {
                    map.put(word.reversed(), map.get(word.reversed())!! - 1)
                }else {
                    map.remove(word.reversed())
                }
                answer += 4
            }else {
                map.put(word , map.getOrDefault(word , 0) + 1)
            }
            
        }
        
        map.forEach { entry ->
            if(hasMiddle && (answer / 2) % 2 == 0 && (entry.key.reversed() == entry.key)) answer += 2
        }
        
        
        return answer
    }
}
```

The Time Complexity of this solution is O(n)
