Problem From.

https://leetcode.com/problems/increasing-triplet-subsequence/

This problem is finding increasing Triplet Subsequence from given IntArray.

First, I try to solve this problem with Map, put index in the Key and Int to Value. However, I change my mind to solve with simple method

Also, I can use double for loop to solve this problem, but that will give O(n2) time complexity, so I don't want to use that method.

Using one for loop, save first smallest value in first, and save second smallest value in second. If we got third smallest value, then return true.

```
class Solution {
    fun increasingTriplet(nums: IntArray): Boolean {
        var first = Int.MAX_VALUE
        var second = Int.MAX_VALUE

        nums.forEach { num ->
            if (num <= first) first = num
            else if (num <= second) second = num
            else return true
        }
        
        return false
        
    }
}
```
