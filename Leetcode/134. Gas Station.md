Problem From.

https://leetcode.com/problems/gas-station/

The problem says solution must be exist and it is unique.

Therefore, Loop gas IntArray, if tank = gas[i] - cost[i] is smaller than 0, reset gas tank and set index = i + 1

Finally if total is smaller than 0, return -1

```
class Solution {
    fun canCompleteCircuit(gas: IntArray, cost: IntArray): Int {
        
        var total = 0
        var tank = 0
        var index = 0
        
        for(i in 0 until gas.size) {
            
            total += gas[i] - cost[i]
            tank += gas[i] - cost[i]
            
            if(tank < 0) {
                tank = 0
                index = i + 1
            }
        
        }
        
        return if(total < 0) -1 else index
        
    }
}
```

The time complexity of this problem will be O(n)
