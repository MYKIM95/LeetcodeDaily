https://leetcode.com/problems/online-stock-span/

To find the maximum number of consecutive days for which the stock price was less than or equal to today's price, used the arrayList to accumulate prices.

Check every time when price comes into the list.

```
class StockSpanner() {

    var list = arrayListOf<Int>()
    
    fun next(price: Int): Int {
        
        var cnt = 1
        
        for(i in list.size - 1 downTo 0) {
            if(list[i] <= price) {
                cnt += 1
            }else {
                break
            }
        }
        
        list.add(price)
        
        return cnt
    }

}

/**
 * Your StockSpanner object will be instantiated and called as such:
 * var obj = StockSpanner()
 * var param_1 = obj.next(price)
 */
