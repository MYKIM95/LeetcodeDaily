Problem From.

https://leetcode.com/problems/contains-duplicate-ii/

Find same numbers in given array, then subtract smaller one from bigger one to get absolute value.

If that value is same or smaller than K, return true.

When we use nested loop, we can solve this problem easily. However, the time complexity will be O(n^2).

We can solve this problem with time complexity O(n), if we use HashMap

```
class Solution {
    fun containsNearbyDuplicate(nums: IntArray, k: Int): Boolean {
        
        val map = HashMap<Int, Int>()
        
        nums.forEachIndexed { index, num ->
            
            if(map.containsKey(num) && index - map.get(num)!! <= k) return true
            
            map.put(num, index)
        }
        
        return false
        
    }
}
```

Considering about the time complexity is important when we are solving algorithm problems.
