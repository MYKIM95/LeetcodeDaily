Problem From.

https://leetcode.com/problems/delete-node-in-a-linked-list/

Today's problem is a bit easy if we know well about LinkedList.

The problem ask us to not just delete the value of specific node, but overwrite it with next node.

So I bring the value of next node and put into the given node's value. Then, bring the node after next to link with present node.

```
/**
 * Example:
 * var li = ListNode(5)
 * var v = li.`val`
 * Definition for singly-linked list.
 * class ListNode(var `val`: Int) {
 *     var next: ListNode? = null
 * }
 */

class Solution {
    fun deleteNode(node: ListNode?) {
        
        node!!.`val` = node.next.`val`
        node!!.next = node.next.next        
        
    }
}
```
