Problem From.

https://leetcode.com/problems/break-a-palindrome/

Today's problem is about breaking palindromic string by replacing one character with any other lowercase English letter.

Then, return lexicographically smallest one among the changed results.

I can solve this problem step by step.

First, if the given string has length 1, I cannot break Palindrome so return empty String "".

To find lexicographically smallest one, I have to change a character which is not "a" to "a" by searching from the first to last.

If all letters are "a", then change last letter to "b" which makes lexicographically smallest one.

```
class Solution {
    fun breakPalindrome(palindrome: String): String {
        
        if(palindrome.length == 1) return ""
        
        val array = palindrome.map{it.toString()}.toTypedArray()
        
        for(index in 0 until array.size / 2) {
            if(array[index] != "a") {
                array[index] = "a"
                return array.joinToString("")
            }
        }
        
        array[array.size - 1] = "b"
        
        return array.joinToString("")
    }
}
```

Sometimes, it is fun to solve step by step problem like this.
