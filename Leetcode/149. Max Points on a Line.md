Problem From.

https://leetcode.com/problems/max-points-on-a-line/

In the given array points, find the max points that in the same line.

First, select the start point to find the slope with the other points.

If the slope is same, add 1 to the map which have slope as key and number of point as value.

Most important part is renew the map when select the starting point.

Finally add 1 to the answer because we miss the start point in our calculation.

```
class Solution {
    fun maxPoints(points: Array<IntArray>): Int {
        var max = 0
        
        for(i in 0 until points.size) {
            
            val map = hashMapOf<Double, Int>()
            
            for(j in 0 until points.size) {
                
                if(points[i] == points[j]) continue
                
                val slope = (points[j][0] - points[i][0]) / (points[j][1] - points[i][1]).toDouble()
                map.put(slope , map.getOrDefault(slope, 0) + 1)   
                max = Math.max(max, map.getOrDefault(slope, 0))
                
            }
        }
        return max + 1  
    }
}
```

The time complexity of this solution will be
