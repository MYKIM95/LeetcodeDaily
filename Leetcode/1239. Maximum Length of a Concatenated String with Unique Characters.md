Problem From.

https://leetcode.com/problems/maximum-length-of-a-concatenated-string-with-unique-characters/

Use given list, string s is formed by the concatenation of a subsequence of the given list that has unique characters.

To find the maximum possible length of s, I used DFS to find all possibilities.

Use string.toSet() method and compare size of list with the length of string. If those two are different, we can say the string is consisted with duplicated characters.

```
class Solution {
    
    private var answer = 0
    
    fun maxLength(arr: List<String>): Int {
        
        findMax(0, "", arr)

        return answer
    }
    
    private fun findMax(index : Int, letter : String, arr : List<String>) {
        
        if(index >= arr.size) return
        if(letter.toSet().size != letter.length) return
        if(letter.length > answer) answer = letter.length

        for(i in index until arr.size){
            findMax(i, letter + arr[i], arr)
        }

    }
    
}
```
