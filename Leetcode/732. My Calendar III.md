Problem From.

https://leetcode.com/problems/my-calendar-iii/

This problem is about returning how many events are happening at the same time.

At the first, I thought when I got [5,10], it happens same time with [10,20], [10,40] and [5,15]

However, the problem always requires the largest number of events therefore, when I got [5,10], it only intersect with [5,15].

This is smaller then when I got [5, 15] which intersect with [10,20], [10,40].

Make Tree Map which

event start time as Key, +1 as value

event end time as Key, -1 as value

then, iterate map from start to end.

We can find some point when largest number of events happens same time, and we can return that as answer.

```
class MyCalendarThree() {

    val map = TreeMap<Int, Int>()
    
    fun book(start: Int, end: Int): Int {
        
        map.put(start, map.getOrDefault(start, 0) + 1)
        map.put(end, map.getOrDefault(end, 0) - 1)
        
        var events = 0
        var answer = 0
        
        map.forEach { entry ->
            events += entry.value
            answer = Math.max(answer, events)
        }   
        return answer
    }
}
```
